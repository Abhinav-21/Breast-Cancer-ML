# LifeSaver ML Models

Welcome to LifeSaver ML Models, an advanced machine learning platform that utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms to predict crucial health outcomes. Our models are designed to assess the survival of breast cancer patients, determine obesity risk, and predict the presence of diabetes in individuals.

## Features

1. **Breast Cancer Survival Prediction:** Our advanced model analyzes various medical parameters and provides accurate predictions of the survival rates for breast cancer patients. This enables healthcare professionals to make informed decisions regarding treatment plans and patient care.

2. **Obesity Risk Assessment:** With our obesity prediction model, individuals can assess their risk of developing obesity based on key factors such as age, lifestyle, diet, and physical activity. This empowers users to take proactive measures towards maintaining a healthy weight and overall well-being.

3. **Diabetes Detection:** Our cutting-edge machine learning model accurately detects the presence of diabetes in individuals. By analyzing vital health indicators such as blood glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), and family history, our model provides reliable predictions that aid in early diagnosis and effective management of diabetes.
